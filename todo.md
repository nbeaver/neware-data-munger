- [ ] Break out of expect script when it doesn't work.
- [ ] Add `gnuplot` output file with embedded data for quick plotting.
- [ ] Automate tests of interactive input using `expect`.
- [ ] Make Origin recognize the `.csv` as an XYXYXY... file, not an XYYYY.. file.
- [ ] Plot derivative of charge and discharge curves to identify plateaus.
- [ ] Process layered report output as well.
- [ ] Put the number of the cycle at the beginning of the filename to make it easier to sort.
- [ ] Generate an EZStat-style `.csv` file.
- [ ] Add mass to outputs as a sanity check.
- [*] Use existing mass if datafile contains it (e.g. "This datafile uses an active material mass of 1.3 mg. Continue using this value?")
- [*] Capacity vs cycle number output file.
- [*] Output a file that is convenient for plotting with `Origin`_.
- [*] Reference by spreadsheet column name, not column number (e.g. 'A', not 0, and 'Q', not 16).
- [*] Add a prompt so that it can be run successfully without arguments.
- [*] Output directory containing files for individual cycles.
- [*] Add an optional "mass?" prompt.
- [*] Infer `.csv` data columns based on headers.
- [*] Generate a dedicated Grace output file.
